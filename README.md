### Key Components
1. **MathAdventureGame Class** (main.py)
   - Manages game window and page navigation
   - Handles player data and game state

2. **ProblemGenerator Class** (utils.py)
   - Creates math problems based on difficulty
   - Generates answer options with distractors

3. **JellyfishManager Class** (game_objects.py)
   - Creates and animates jellyfish with physics
   - Manages answer bubble display

4. **ScoreManager Class** (utils.py)
   - Saves and loads high scores
   - Tracks player progress

5. **AudioManager Class** (utils.py)
   - Handles background music and sound effects
   - Provides music toggle functionality

## üé® Customization
You can modify these files to customize your game experience:

1. **Adjust Difficulty**:
   - Modify `QUESTIONS_PER_GAME` and `TIME_PER_QUESTION` in `Game_core.py`
   - Edit problem parameters in `utils.py` (ProblemGenerator class)

2. **Change Visuals**:
   - Replace images in `assets/Images/` (maintain same filenames)
   - Modify colors in `BACKGROUND_COLORS` dictionary in `Game_core.py`

3. **Modify Game Mechanics**:
   - Adjust jellyfish speed in `SPEEDS` dictionary in `game_objects.py`
   - Change scoring values in `LEVEL_POINTS` in `Game_core.py`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Images/Sounds**:
   - Ensure all asset files are in correct folders
   - Verify filenames match code references

2. **Pygame Installation Issues**:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall pygame
   pip install pygame --pre
   ```

3. **Window Size Problems**:
   - Game automatically adjusts - try resizing manually
   - For persistent issues, modify `_adjust_window_size()` in `main.py`

4. **Name Validation Errors**:
   - Names must be 3-15 characters
   - Only letters, numbers and spaces allowed
   - Must be unique on leaderboard

### Running Without Audio
If pygame installation fails, the game will still run with full functionality except audio. You'll see "MUSIC OFF" in the top-right corner.
