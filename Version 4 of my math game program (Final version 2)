Here's a comprehensive summary of the key changes between the old and new versions, presented in a single cohesive paragraph suitable for a GitHub commit description:

**The new version significantly enhances the educational game through major feature additions, UI/UX improvements, and technical optimizations. We've implemented a robust error tracking system that records wrong answers with full context (question, correct answer, user's answer, options, and question number) using `self.wrong_questions = []` and `self.current_question_data = {...}`. This enables a powerful new review feature (`show_wrong_questions_summary()`) that displays mistakes in a scrollable window with color-coded feedback (‚ùå user answers in red, ‚úÖ correct answers in green). The game completion/end dialogs have been completely redesigned as custom Toplevel windows (`dialog = tk.Toplevel(); dialog.geometry("1000x700")`) replacing basic messageboxes, featuring performance statistics (üìä accuracy percentages), leaderboard positioning info (`_get_leaderboard_info()` showing ü•á/ü•à/ü•â rankings), and difficulty-specific learning tips. Audio handling has been enhanced with auto-playing background music (`_start_music()` calling `pygame.mixer.music.play(-1)`) and more resilient error handling through try/except blocks around all sound operations. Visual improvements include animated jellyfish using wave algorithms (`wave_x = math.sin(current_time * 0.8 + offset) * 2`), better collision detection with position correction, and UI polish with consistent SpongeBob-themed colors. Educational value was boosted by showing correct answers after timeouts/errors and extending feedback display time to 2000ms. Technical optimizations include smoother boundary handling (`jelly['dx'] = abs(jelly['dx']) * 0.9`), efficient timer management using `after()` calls, and comprehensive exception handling throughout.**

Key evidence from code changes:
1. Error tracking: `self.wrong_questions.append({'question': ..., 'user_answer': ..., 'correct_answer': ...})`
2. Review system: `show_wrong_questions_summary()` creating scrollable Tkinter windows with question analysis
3. Custom dialogs: 1000x700 pixel Toplevel windows replacing messageboxes
4. Audio enhancements: `_start_music()` implementation and `try/except` around all sound calls
5. Visual improvements: Jellyfish wave animation using time-based offsets
6. Educational features: Correct answer display in feedback labels after errors
7. Technical optimizations: Boundary handling with decay coefficients (0.9) and timer management

These changes create a more engaging, educational, and technically robust gaming experience while providing valuable learning analytics through the new review system.
